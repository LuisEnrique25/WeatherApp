# WeatherApp

Second Academlo Project that consist of a simple WeatherAPP.

Tailwind was used for the design, thanks to the fact that it is oriented to mobile-first by default, it was easier make the Responsive Design.

DarkMode was implemented with tailwind and localStorage.

Main hooks used were useState and UseEffect:
  * useState => to make changes to the state.
  * useEffect => to get the permission to know the coordinates from the user.
 
The consumed API was provided by 'openweathermap.org' and we use axios to be able to use it.
